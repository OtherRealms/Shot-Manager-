Getting Started
---------------
Shot Manager is an addon for Blender 2.8 and above. Created as a  tool by myself Pablo Tochez [contact@pablotochez.com]  in order assist in the organisation of complex files containing multiple shots, view layers and cameras. I am by no means a programmer but rather an artist with some basic coding knowledge for making  time saving tools and digital artworks.
Shot Manager should be intalled like any .zip addon [Blender 2.8 Install Addons 00:38-https://youtu.be/14G_YIVdBd0?t=38].
